<h3>Mumbai, the capital city of Maharashtra is called the “city of dreams” or “Mayanagri” as they call. It has gained this epithet over the years not just because it offers limitless opportunities for the Indian citizens across the states, but also for people across the borders.The city is one of the world's top centers of commerce in terms of financial flow. It is also home to important financial institutions, such as the Reserve Bank of India, the Bombay Stock Exchange, the National Stock Exchange of India, and corporate headquarters of many Indian companies and multinational corporations.As the commercial capital of the country, Mumbai has much appeal to anyone in search of work and better career prospects. Migrants from every part of the country move to the city every day in search of a better life, hence the name 'City of Dreams' was coined.
It is also a city with strong historical links, wonderful British architecture, museums, beaches, places of worship, and above all, a true galaxy of stars where Bollywood reigns supreme.</h3>

<br>
<font size="4">To be honest, living in Mumbai is both a curse and a blessing.

On the one hand you have to deal with the hordes of people on the streets, but on the other, you also have friendly and helpful locals and people who smile at you on the street for no reason.

A home to Indians from all walks of life, the city has an amazing multi-cultural vibe, a thriving nightlife scene, budget-friendly stores, and access to food from a range of cultures.</font>

<h2 align="center"><u>Weather in Mumbai</u></h2>
<br>
<font size="4">
The Indian Meteorological Department has classified four main seasons in India – Winter, Summer or Pre-monsoon, Monsoon, Autumn or Post-monsoon, – but it sometimes feels like just three with a bit of variation.

Winter lasts from December through February with end-December to mid-Jan being the coldest, but it rarely dips below 50 °F (10 °C). For real winter weather, head to the Northern States of India, where you’ll find snowy mountains and sometimes even get to stay in igloos.

Summer is really hot with temperatures in May averaging around 86 to 95 °F (30 to 35 °C) and the maximum ever recorded being 105 °F (40.6 °C) in 1955. Be sure to carry water around with you from March through May so you don’t suffer from a heat stroke.</font>
